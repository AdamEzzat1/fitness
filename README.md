# Fitness Watch Data Analysis (Draft)

This is a project exploring methods for analyzing data collected from fitness watches. Fitness watch data can provide valuable insights into user health and wellness, allowing businesses to develop personalized solutions and improve user well-being.

## Process:

### Data Collection:

- Gather data from fitness watches, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- Data sources can include user apps, fitness watch APIs, or simulated data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Gain initial insights into the data through techniques like:
  - Summarizing statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
  - Identifying data distribution patterns (histograms, boxplots)
  - Visualizing relationships between variables (scatter plots)
  - Exploring missing values and outliers

### Feature Engineering:

- Create new features from existing data to enhance analysis.
- Examples include:
  - Activity intensity based on step count and heart rate
  - Daily activity goals achieved
  - Sleep quality metrics derived from sleep duration and sleep stages

### Data Visualization:

- Create clear and informative visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
- Consider using:
  - Line charts for trends over time (steps per day)
  - Bar charts for comparisons between categories (average sleep duration by age)
  - Heatmaps to visualize correlations between multiple variables

## Getting Started

This section will detail how to set up the codebase and dependencies. Please refer to the project's wiki for specific instructions: [wiki: How to Setup the Project](wiki: How to Setup the Project).

## Data Example

A sample data file (e.g., CSV) demonstrating the data format used in the analysis is available in the data folder.

## Next Steps

- Implement the data analysis steps outlined above.
- Integrate data visualization libraries to create charts and graphs.
- Refine the analysis based on findings from each stage.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions to this project! Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements or additional functionalities.
